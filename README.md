# hashing-program
This is an application of cryptographic Hash Functions. Cryptographic hash functions are the functions which produce an output from which reaching the input is close to impossible. This property of hash functions is called irreversibility. 
Clicking "Find duplicates" Deleto file manager will work as duplicate finder utility, displaying size and hash or checksum value only for duplicate files - same binary identical content featured in two or more distinct files.
I used Java and JavaFx to build this software.
